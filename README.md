# STM32F405RG_AHRS_ICM20602_FXOS8700S

Attitude Heading Reference System implementation using Madwick algorithm on STM32F405 Arm Cortex-M4 Microcontroller.

All peripherals are my own baremetal implementation (SPI, I2C, GPIO, UART, SYSTICK etc.)
Also USBD CDC user interface and circular buffers are implemented.
